An example: sentiment classification
====================================

This directory shows a simple sentiment classification example:

* `index.html` is setup with an HTML template that displays a sentence and sets
  an output variable as true or false.
* `task.py` and `task.yaml` contain filled in task configurations: that are
  specialized for this task. You'll get identical copies by running `texpy
  init`.

To test this example, run `texpy new`: it will create a new numbered directory
for your experiment.
